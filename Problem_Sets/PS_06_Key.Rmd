## Exact CIs vs. approximate CIs


## PS 4 Possums


## PS 5 Stalk-eyed flies

Stalk-eyed flies are a group of flies whose eyes are at the ends of long projections ("stalks") on either side of their head. Shortly after emerging from the pupa, these flies ingest air through their mouth and pump it into these stalks to elongate them ([watch this amazing process here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGdfIX5x8XM){target="_blank"}). 

Females prefer males with wider eye spans. See the photo below:

The `Stalkies.csv` data file contains data for an experiment in which male stalk-eyed flies (*Cyrtodiopsis dalmanni*) were reared on different food sources (`food_source`: corn and cotton). The distance between the eyes in millimeters is recorded as `eye_span`.^[David, P., T. Bjorksten, K. Fowler, and A. Pomiankowski. 2000. Condition-dependent signalling of genetic variation in stalk-eyed flies. *Nature* 406: 186-188.]

The hypothesis is that food type affects eye span. In this exercise, you will try to answer this question.

### Activity

Load the `Stalkies.csv` file and explicitly mutate `food_source` into a factor. Examine the columns of data it contains.

```{r}
# FIXME

stalk <- read_csv("../data/Stalkies.csv", show_col_types = FALSE) |> 
  mutate(food_source = factor(food_source))
glimpse(stalk)
```

Visualize the data set in two different ways by making two different plots:

1. Make a boxplot showing each food type on the x-axis using `geom_boxplot()`. We haven't gone over boxplots, but here is a website with a good overview: [https://www.atlassian.com/data/charts/box-plot-complete-guide](https://www.atlassian.com/data/charts/box-plot-complete-guide){target="_blank"}. See if you can set up the boxplot so that the food source is on the x-axis and eye span on the y-axis.
2. Plot the raw data (points) for the two groups.
    - For the points, include jitter and transparency.
    - Include a point for the means and error bars standard errors of the mean plotted in a different color (the code in Lecture 05-1 "Plot raw data with summary stats" will help you).
    - Try a few different values for each of these elements (jitter, color, transparency) to find a plot you feel best communicates the structure of the data. You will find that the number of data points you have will affect how much jitter & transparency is most appropriate.
    - Change the axis labels to what you would expect to find on a publication ready figure.

```{r}
# FIXME

ggplot(stalk, aes(x = food_source, y = eye_span)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(x = "Food Source", y = "Eye Span (mm)")

ggplot(stalk, aes(x = food_source, y = eye_span)) +
  geom_point(position = position_jitter(width = 0.2, seed = 423479),
             alpha = 0.25, pch = 16) +
  stat_summary(fun = mean,
               geom = "point",
               size = 3, color = "purple") + 
  stat_summary(fun.data = mean_se,
               geom = "errorbar",
               width = 0.1,
               linewidth = 1,
               color = "purple") +
  labs(x = "Food Source", y = "Eye Span (mm)")
```

Describe the distributions within each group and between groups. What do these plots tell you? Do you have a prediction for what your statistical tests will show? How does the information provided by the boxplot differ from the information conveyed by the second plot.

> The mean eye span is higher for flies reared on corn than on cotton. The variation also appears to be greater for flies reared on cotton. Based on the standard errors, I predict there will be a significant difference between these groups. The boxplot hides all the data. There is no way to tell the sample sizes. One benefit is that it is easier to compare the spread of the data with a box. Hiding the data is the main reason that I prefer dots, means, and error bars to boxplots.


#### Summary statistics

For each food source calculate: the number of observations, mean, standard deviation, variance, and standard error of the mean.

Use `group_by()` and `summarize()` as we have seen in the lecture slides. Remember that there is no SEM function built-in with R. Copy the function from the lecture slides and use it here.

```{r}
# FIXME

SEM <- function(x) {sd(x) / sqrt(length(x))}

stalk |> 
  group_by(food_source) |> 
  summarise(n = length(eye_span),
            mean_eye_span = mean(eye_span),
            sd_eye_span = sd(eye_span),
            var_eye_span = var(eye_span),
            SEM_eye_span = SEM(eye_span))
```

How do the number of observations, mean, standard deviation, variance, and SEM compare? Do they match your intuition above?

> The number of observations is pretty similar (21 vs. 24). Mean eyespan is about 0.5 mm higher in corn-fed flies. Standard deviation is about 4x higher in cotton, and variance is 14x higher. SEM is about 3.5x higher.


#### Intervals

Calculate approximate 95% confidence intervals for the mean eye span for each group. You can either do the calculations step-by-step as we did for the gliding snakes example or using `group_by()` and `summarize()` like we did for the horned lizard example.

```{r}
# FIXME

stalk |> 
  group_by(food_source) |> 
  summarize(mean_eye_span = mean(eye_span),
            SEM_eye_span = SEM(eye_span),
            Lower = mean_eye_span - 2 * SEM_eye_span,
            Upper = mean_eye_span + 2 * SEM_eye_span)
```

What are the approximate 95% confidence intervals for the mean eye span for flies raised on corn and cotton? What is your hypothesis for whether the means differ or not? How confident are you in your hypothesis?

> The interval for corn is 2.01 - 2.08 mm and for cotton in 1.43 - 1.66 mm. The intervals don't overlap and and very separated. So the means are very likely different.


#### Tests of means

Finally we can fit the linear model where eye span is modeled by food source.

`lm()` is a general function that fits many many different kinds of linear models. We will use `lm()` almost exclusively in the coming units.

1. Fit a linear model using `lm()` where `eye_span` is modeled by `food_source` and assign this to an object.
2. Pass the object that you just created to the function `summary()` to generate the model summary.

```{r}
# FIXME

fm <- lm(eye_span ~ food_source, data = stalk)
summary(fm)
```

Examine the coefficients in the model summary. Try to reconcile the values in the `Estimate` column for the rows: `(Intercept)` and `food_sourceCotton` with the means you calculated above.

> The intercept is identical to the mean for the corn group. The second row in the coefficients `food_sourceCotton` is the same value as the difference between the mean for Corn and the mean for Cotton. So this row represents the mean difference between Corn and Cotton.


We will investigate the other parts of this summary in the coming units. Next, we will use a *t*-test to estimate the difference in means in the two treatments.

By default, the `t.test` function will perform a test that *does not* assume equal variances (called "Welch's Correction"). You may specify equal variances with `var.equal = TRUE`, *if you decide that is appropriate here*. Refer back to to the summaries (mean, sd, variance) you calculated above.

Perform a *t*-test using the formula method to specify the groups to test. The formula will be identical to the formula for `lm()`. Print the results.

```{r}
# FIXME

myT <- t.test(eye_span ~ food_source, data = stalk)
myT
```

Study the printed output of `t.test()`. Do you find the means for the Corn and Cotton groups? Do these match your calculation above?

> Corn: 2.04; Cotton: 1.54. Yes, these are identical


`t.test()` is a function that performs a very specific task: carrying out a *t*-test (by default with Welch's correction for unequal variances). A *t*-test is just a special kind of linear model (1 categorical predictor with 2 levels), so we can also fit the same model using `lm()`. There are a few different kinds of *t*-test that you can do with `t.test()`, but all of them are just specific kinds of linear models.

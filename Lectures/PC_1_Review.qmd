## Micropublications [https://www.micropublication.org/](https://www.micropublication.org/)

> "brief, novel findings, negative and/or reproduced results, and results which may lack a broader scientific narrative."

- New finding - novel discoveries, new reagents and/or methods
- Null/negative result
- Replication - successful (including being scooped)
- Replication - unsuccessful
- Materials and Reagents
- Methodology
- Data updates

Not every publication needs to be expansive.

## Project

Produce a *reproducible* micropublication-style report (3-5 pages)

- Scientific question / Background
- Use your own data or data from the literature
    - I will help you
- Methods and analysis
    - Describing analyses and writing about results
- A figure (can be multi-panel, can have images, must be reproducible)
- A table (if needed)
- References


## Skills

- Determining appropriate analyses to answer questions
- Writing about statistics
- Making publication-ready figures (colors, font size, etc.)
- Making tables
- Writing figure captions and table headers
- Extracting information from R during rendering
- Including references
- HTML or PDF (I will provide templates)
- Presenting


## Key dates

- 4/15: Plan due
    - Question
    - Dataset
    - Figure plan
    - Analysis ideas

# Questions {background-color="#f8c471"}


## When to separate vs. combine operations

> Can we combine multiple logical operations in a single line? For example, when we did PS_2 and were trying to figure out how much data was outside one standard deviation of the mean, we isolated the data points less than -1 and greater than 1 in separate lines. Could this be condensed by asking for data that is either less than -1 or larger than 1 in only one logical test?

Being concise at the expense of clarity


## When to separate vs. combine operations

```{r}
#| echo: true

set.seed(732646)
x <- rnorm(10000, mean = 0, sd = 1)
```


## What to put where in `ggplot()`

> Is there a rule of thumb for understanding if the code for a plot should go inside the parentheses of ggplot, be added on with +, or be added using the pipe?


## Let's make a plot

```{r}
# Histogram

lines <- tibble(vlines = seq(-3, 3, by = 1))

ggplot() +
  geom_histogram(data = tibble(x),
                 mapping = aes(x),
                 bins = 30, fill = "purple") +
  geom_vline(data = lines,
             mapping = aes(xintercept = vlines),
             color = "orange")

# Density plot
ggplot() +
  geom_density(data = tibble(x),
               mapping = aes(x),
               fill = "purple") +
  geom_vline(data = lines,
             mapping = aes(xintercept = vlines),
             color = "orange")
```


## When to separate vs. combine operations

```{r}
#| echo: true

gt_1 <- x > 1  # T/F vectors
lt_1 <- x < -1

sum(gt_1)
sum(lt_1)
```

. . .

```{r}
#| echo: true
(sum(gt_1) + sum(lt_1)) / 10000
(10000 - (sum(gt_1) + sum(lt_1))) / 10000
```


## When to separate vs. combine operations

```{r}
#| echo: true

set.seed(732646)
x <- rnorm(10000, mean = 0, sd = 1)

mean(x < -1 | x > 1)
mean(x > -1 & x < 1)
```

. . .

Combining logical operations: `&` (and); `|` (or)

> "`all.equal(x, y)` is a utility to compare R objects x and y testing 'near equality'."

- `tolerance = 1e-3`
- `isTRUE(all.equal(x, y))`


## Combining logical operations

```{r}
#| echo: true

v1 <- c(TRUE, TRUE, TRUE)
v2 <- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)

v1 & v2
v1 | v2

all.equal(v1, v2)
isTRUE(all.equal(v1, v2))
```

## Extracting data from analyses

> Is there a way to ask R to "pull out" data from an automatically generated set of information (for example, the summary of the least squares regression function lm)? I could see it being useful to automatically pull out data and assign it to a variable for further processing.


## Simulate data

```{r}
#| echo: true

set.seed(42)

W <- tibble(x = seq(0, 100, by = 5),
            y = 3 * x + 2 + rnorm(length(x),
                                  mean = 0,
                                  sd = 25))

ggplot(W, aes(x, y)) +
  geom_point()
```


## Look at an `lm()` summary

```{r}
#| echo: true

# "Fitted model"
fm <- lm(y ~ x + 1, data = W)

# summary(fm)
coef(fm)
```

The slope is `r round(coef(fm)[2], 2)` and the intercept is `r round(coef(fm)[1], 2)`.


## Examining object structures with `str()`

```{r}
#| echo: true

fm$coefficients

s <- summary(fm)
s$coefficients
```


## Using the tidyverse: `broom`

- `broom::tidy()`
- `broom::glance()`
- `broom::augment()`

```{r}
#| echo: true

library(broom)

tidy(fm)

glance(fm)

W <- augment(fm, data = W)
```


## Inline code in Rmd/qmd files

```{r}
#| echo: true

set.seed(34)
x <- rnorm(100, mean = 10, sd = 1)
```

The mean of x is `r round(mean(x), 2)`.


## Coloring points

```{r}
set.seed(42)

W <- tibble(x = seq(0, 100, by = 5),
            y = 3 * x + 2 + rnorm(length(x),
                                  mean = 0,
                                  sd = 25),
            Group = "G1")
W2 <- tibble(x = seq(0, 100, by = 5),
             y = 5 * x + 12 + rnorm(length(x),
                                    mean = 0,
                                    sd = 25),
             Group = "G2")

WW <- bind_rows(W, W2)

ggplot() +
  geom_point(data = WW, aes(x, y, color = Group)) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("purple", "pink"))

library(ggsci)
ggplot() +
  geom_point(data = WW, aes(x, y, color = Group)) +
  scale_color_bmj()

library(paletteer)
ggplot() +
  geom_point(data = WW, aes(x, y, color = Group)) +
  scale_color_paletteer_d("nbapalettes::pacers_classic")
```

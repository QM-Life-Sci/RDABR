## Effects of selection

```{r}
C <- readr::read_csv("../data/Mice/Mouse_Control.csv",
                     show_col_types = FALSE) |> 
  mutate(Generation = rep(0:10, times = 4),
         Line = rep(1:4, each = 11),
         LineType = "Control Lines") |> 
  rename(Revolutions = y)
HR <- readr::read_csv("../data/Mice/Mouse_HR.csv",
                      show_col_types = FALSE) |> 
  mutate(Generation = rep(0:10, times = 4),
         Line = rep(5:8, each = 11),
         LineType = "Selected Lines") |> 
  rename(Revolutions = y)

DD <- bind_rows(C, HR)

ggplot(DD, aes(x = Generation, y = Revolutions,
               group = Line,
               color = LineType)) +
  geom_line(linewidth = 1) +
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("navy", "firebrick"), name = NULL) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = 0:10) +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 12000), labels = scales::comma) +
  theme(legend.position = "inside",
        legend.position.inside = c(0.1, 0.9),
        axis.title = element_text(face = "bold")) +
  labs(y = "Revolutions / Day")
```


## What patterns do you see?

```{r}
MM <- readr::read_rds("../data/Mice/MouseMuscle.rds") |> 
  mutate(Line = factor(Line)) |> 
  drop_na() |> 
  filter(Sex == "Female")

ggplot(MM, aes(x = Body_Mass,
               y = Muscle_Mass,
               color = Line)) +
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("navy", "firebrick", "lightblue")) +
  labs(x = "**Body Mass (g)**",
       y = "**Muscle Mass (g)**") +
  theme(strip.background = NULL,
        strip.text = element_text(color = "black", face = "bold",
                                  size = 12),
        axis.title.x = element_markdown(),
        axis.title.y = element_markdown())
```


## Assumptions of science as a way of knowing

- All ways of knowing involve a set of assumptions
- Our knowledge is conditional on these assumptions being met

What assumptions do we make about these mice?

## Definitions of statistics

"a collection of procedures and principles for gaining **information** in order to make decisions when faced with **uncertainty**" [@Utts2005-mg]

"a way of taming **uncertainty**, of turning raw **data** into arguments that can resolve profound questions" [@Amabile1989-pf]

"the science of drawing conclusions from **data** with the aid of the mathematics of **probability**" [@Garfunkel1986-vv]

"the **explanation** of **variation** in the context of what remains **unexplained**" [@Kaplan2009-zu]


## Key concepts in statistics

**Data**: The raw material for doing statistics are data, which come in a variety of forms.

**Information**: The goal of statistics is to gain information, make a decision, or explain.

**Uncertainty**: The context for statistics is that there is always some level of uncertainty

**Probability**: The tool that we will use to assess our uncertainty and gain information is probability.


## Statistics in the context of life sciences

- Describe, measure, and compare aspects of nature from **samples**
- Quantify the **uncertainty** of those measures
- **Estimation** of an unknown quantity from a **sample** of a **population**
    - *Differences* between groups
    - *Relationships* between variables or traits


## Samples and populations

A **population** includes all the members/individuals/units of a group of interest.

- A parameter is a quantity that describes a population without error (e.g., means, standard deviations, proportions).
- Requires measuring *every* member of that group.


## Samples and populations

A **sample** is a representative subset of a population, ideally randomly chosen. A sample can be an individual subject or a group of subjects.

- An estimate is the inferred value of a parameter based on a sample from a population.

*You will (usually) deal with samples.*


## Deviations resulting from sampling

**Sampling error** is the deviation from the population parameter resulting from chance alone.

- **Precision** is the amount of spread among the observations around the true population parameter resulting from sampling error.

**Bias/Inaccuracy** is the *systematic departure* of an estimate from the population parameter being estimated.


## Goals of data collection: Low sampling error and low bias {#myImagePage}

## Thinking about sampling error and bias

Consider the scale in a physician's office. The same patient is weighed 3 times in succession:

1. 72.0 kg
2. 73.8 kg
3. 70.1 kg

True mass is 72.1 kg. Sampling error or bias?


## Thinking about sampling error and bias

Consider the same physician's thermometer. The same patient's temperature 3 times in succession:

1. 98.2째
2. 98.3째
3. 98.2째

True temperature is 99.3째. Sampling error or bias?

*What is the real challenge here?*


## Testing for bias

- Standard curves
- Calibration
- Simulation


## Randomness

A repeatable process is random if its outcome is

- Unpredictable in the short run
- Predictable in the long run

e.g., coin flipping (fair coin)

- We don't know what the result of a single flip will be
- We do know what the long run probability of heads will be


## Random sampling

Assumptions of most statistical analyses

1. **Equal chance**: Each member of a population has an equal chance of being included in the sample
2. **Independence**: No member that is chosen influences the others that are chosen *or* their outcomes (e.g., trait values)

*Goals*:

- Minimize bias
- Allow an estimation of sampling error (important)


## Independent and identically distributed (IID)

- All observations are independent of one another
- All observations come from the same underlying probability distribution (distributions in Unit 2)

## Sampling design for a forest

Randomly select 20 trees (left) or randomly select 20 square areas with 0 or more trees (right).

- Three-week check in (link on Canvas)
- PS 2 due sometime soon
- Start PS 3 today
- Any other questions?


# Distributions {background-color="#40666e"}


## Distributions

- All observations can be thought of as coming from a population that can be represented as a distribution
- Flip a coin 6 times and get HHTTHT: one observation in a distribution of possible outcomes (THTHTH, HHHTTT, etc.)
- Catch a rodent in my swimming pool and test its endurance: that data point is one value in the larger distribution of all endurance measures for all rodents


## Distributions most commonly encountered

1. Frequency distribution
    - Shows the number of times each measurement occurs in a sample (possibly "binned")
1. Probability distribution:
    - A probability distribution shows the probability that measurement occurs in a sample.


## What is a (probability) distribution?

Mathematical function for *probabilities* of *possible outcomes*

- *Probabilities*: between 0 and 1
- *Possible outcomes*: real number, integer, binomial (0/1), etc.

Normal distribution ($x$, $\mu$, $\sigma$):

$$
Pr\left[x\right] = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^{2}}}e^{\frac{-\left(x-\mu\right)^{2}}{2\sigma^{2}}}
$$


## Normal distribution

$$
Pr\left[x\right] = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^{2}}}e^{\frac{-\left(x-\mu\right)^{2}}{2\sigma^{2}}}
$$

```{r}
#| echo: true

Normal <- function(x, mu, sigma) {
  (1 / (sqrt(2 * pi * sigma^2))) * exp((-1 * (x - mu)^2) / (2 * sigma^2))
}

Normal(x = 1, mu = 0, sigma = 1)
```

. . .

R has built-in functions for probability distributions ("densities"):

```{r}
#| echo: true

dnorm(x = 1, mean = 0, sd = 1)
```


## Normal distribution

Calculate the probability across the range $-2$ to $2$ for $\mu = 0$ and $\sigma = 1$:

```{r}
#| echo: true
Std_Normal <- tibble(x = seq(-2, 2, length.out = 100),
                     Probability = dnorm(x, mean = 0, sd = 1))
```

Plot the probability as a line:

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: slide

ggplot() +
  geom_line(data = Std_Normal,
            aes(x, Probability),
            color = "darkgreen",
            linewidth = 1.5) +
  geom_point(aes(x = 1, y = dnorm(x = 1, mean = 0, sd = 1)),
             size = 4,
             color = "salmon") +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 0.5, by = 0.05))
```

- Area under the curve = 1 integrating $-\infty < x < \infty$

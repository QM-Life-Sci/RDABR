# Housekeeping {background-color="#40666e"}

- Progress Check 1 due Thursday
    - If you need more time, let me know.
- Be thinking about / looking for a dataset
    - Let me know if you want to discuss
- Change to lecture topic order
- Change in lecture structure


## Plan for this week

- Standard errors: How confident are we in an estimate?
- Intervals around estimates
- Comparison of means
- (Almost) all models are linear models


# Standard errors {background-color="#40666e"}


## Resampling to estimate a mean

```{r}
#| echo: true

set.seed(423766)

x <- rnorm(n = 2000, mean = 10, sd = 4)

resample_means <- function(x, sample_size, n_means) {
  sample_means <- numeric(n_means)
  for (ii in 1:n_means) {
    s <- sample(x, size = sample_size, replace = FALSE)  # <1>
    sample_means[ii] <- mean(s)
  }
  return(sample_means)
}

sm1 <- resample_means(x, sample_size = 20, n_means = 100)
```
1. Randomly sample from x, being sure to not sample the same value twice (`replace = FALSE`).

. . .

```{r}
#| echo: true

sm1[1:10]
```

What will the distribution of sample *means* look like? What will the range be?


## Mean of means: mean = 10, sd = 4

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| warning: false

ggplot(tibble(sm1), aes(sm1)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 30, fill = "gold") +
  labs(x = "Sample Mean", y = "Count",
       title = "sample size = 20; n means = 100") +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(6, 14), breaks = 6:14)
```

       aes(x)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 30, fill = "gold") +
  labs(x = "Sample Mean", y = "Count",
       title = "sample size = 20; n means = 1000") +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(6, 14), breaks = 6:14)
```


## Mean of means: mean = 10, sd = 4

```{r}
#| warning: false

ggplot(tibble(x = resample_means(x, sample_size = 20, n_means = 10000)),
       aes(x)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 30, fill = "gold") +
  labs(x = "Sample Mean", y = "Count",
       title = "sample size = 20; n means = 10000") +

```

```{r}

ggplot(tibble(x = resample_means(x, sample_size = 200, n_means = 100)),
       aes(x)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 30, fill = "gold") +
  labs(x = "Sample Mean", y = "Count",
       title = "sample size = 200; n means = 100") +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(6, 14), breaks = 6:14)
```


## Mean of means: mean = 10, sd = 4

```{r}
#| warning: false

ggplot(tibble(x = resample_means(x, sample_size = 2000, n_means = 100)),
       aes(x)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 30, fill = "gold") +
  labs(x = "Sample Mean", y = "Count",
       title = "sample size = 2000; n means = 100") +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(6, 14), breaks = 6:14)
```


## Standard errors

- Empirically, we see that the estimate is more precise if the samples is larger.
- How can we quantify the level of uncertainty?

Adjust the standard deviation by sample size:

$$
s = \sqrt{\frac{\sum \left(x_i - \bar{x}\right)^2}{n - 1}}
$$

$$SE_{\bar{x}} = \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}$$

How does $SE_{\bar{x}}$ change as $n$ increases?


## Standard error of the sample mean

```{r}
SticklebackPlates <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/QM-Life-Sci/RDABR/refs/heads/main/data/Stickleback_Plates.csv",
                              show_col_types = FALSE)
```

No built-in function in R, so we write our own:

```{r}
#| echo: true

SEM <- function(x) {sd(x) / sqrt(length(x))}
```

Stickleback plate numbers:

```{r}
#| echo: true

SticklebackPlates |> 
  group_by(genotype) |> 
  summarise(Count = length(plates),
            Mean = mean(plates),
            SEM_plates = SEM(plates))
```

Means are very different, but $SE_{\overline{plate}}$ is similar for *MM* and *mm*.


## Standard errors appear often

- Sample mean: "SEM"
- Parameter estimates

```{r}
set.seed(4)
n <- 30

X <- rnorm(n, mean = 10, sd = 1)
Y <- 2.3 * X + rnorm(n, mean = 1, sd = 1)

M <- tibble(X, Y)

lm(Y ~ X + 1, data = M) |> summary()
```


# What can I do with standard errors? {background-color="#40666e"}


## Compare the standard error to the estimate

```{r}
set.seed(324678)
n <- 1000
DD <- tibble(x = c(rnorm(n, 0, 5), rnorm(n, 0, 50)),
             `SD Group` = rep(c("sd = 5", "sd = 50"), each = n))
DD |> 
  group_by(`SD Group`) |> 
  summarize(Count = length(x),
            Mean = mean(x),
            SEM = SEM(x)) |> 
  knitr::kable(digits = 2)
```


## Plot raw data with summary stats

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: slide 

ggplot(SticklebackPlates, aes(x = genotype, y = plates)) +
  geom_point(position = position_jitter(width = 0.2, seed = 423479),
             alpha = 0.25, pch = 16) +
  stat_summary(fun = mean, geom = "point", size = 3, color = "purple") + 
  stat_summary(fun.data = mean_se, geom = "errorbar", width = 0.1,
               color = "purple", linewidth = 1) +
  labs(x = "Genotype", y = "Number of Plates") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(face = "italic"))
```


## Intervals measure uncertainty in a parameter estimate

In what range of values do I expect to find estimates?

- Repeat the same experiment
- Same conditions, sample size, etc.

. . .

```{r}
mu1 <- 24.3
mu2 <- 32.5

DD1 <- tibble("Treatment" = rep(c("A", "B"),each = 8),
              "Phenotype" = c(rnorm(8, mu1), rnorm(8, mu2)),
              "DataSet" = "G1")

DD2 <- tibble("Treatment" = rep(c("A", "B"),each = 8),
              "Phenotype" = c(rnorm(8, mu1, 6), rnorm(8, mu2, 6)),
              "DataSet" = "G2")

DD3 <- tibble("Treatment" = rep(c("A", "B"),each = 80),
              "Phenotype" = c(rnorm(80, mu1), rnorm(80, mu2)),
              "DataSet" = "G3")

DD4 <- tibble("Treatment" = rep(c("A", "B"),each = 80),
              "Phenotype" = c(rnorm(80, mu1, 6), rnorm(80, mu2, 6)),
              "DataSet" = "G4")

DD <- bind_rows(DD1, DD2, DD3, DD4)


DD |>
  ggplot(aes(Treatment, Phenotype)) +
  geom_point(position = position_jitter(width = 0.2, seed = 423479),
             alpha = 0.25, pch = 16,
             size = 2) +
  stat_summary(fun = mean, geom = "point", size = 4, color = "darkred") + 
  facet_wrap("DataSet", nrow = 2)
```


## Confidence interval for a mean

- Approximate calculation
    - $n = 30$ to $n = 100$

$$95\%~CI = \bar{x} \pm 2 \times SEM$$

- Exact calculation using a critical *t*-value and appropriate degrees of freedom
    - $t$-distribution coming later
    - Approximate for now...
  

## Confidence intervals

> A confidence interval is a range that we expect, with some level of conﬁdence, to include the true value of a population parameter such as the mean. [@Curran-Everett2009-zz]

Our calculation is based on our expectation from sampling the true population distribution *repeatedly.*


## Estimating confidence intervals

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

```{r}
#| fig-height: 10
shade_normal(p = 0.025) +
    theme(text = element_text(size = 24))

```

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

- $2$ in $\pm 2 \times SEM$ is an approximation
- True value is ~1.96 for a standard normal distribution (assuming infinite sample size)
- Exact confidence intervals rely on the *t*-distribution
    - Increase width of CI for smaller sample size

## Plotting Confidence Intervals

DD |>
  ggplot(aes(Treatment, Phenotype)) +
  geom_point(position = position_jitter(width = 0.2, seed = 423479),
             alpha = 0.25, pch = 16) +
  stat_summary(fun = mean, geom = "point", size = 3, color = "firebrick4") + 
  stat_summary(fun.data = mean_cl_normal, geom = "errorbar", width = 0.1,
               color = "firebrick4", linewidth = 1) +
  facet_wrap(vars(DataSet), nrow=2)

```


## What Exactly does a confidence interval represent about a sample?

> A confidence interval is a range that we expect, with some level of conﬁdence, to include the true value of a population parameter such as the mean. [@Curran-Everett2009-zz]

Our calculation is based on our expectation from sampling the true population distribution repeatedly.


## Example CI calculation

Mean undulation rate for *n = 8* [gliding snakes](http://www.flyingsnake.org/):

![](http://www.lazerhorse.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Flying-Snake-Chrysopelea.jpg){fig-align="center" width="60%"}

What is the mean undulation rate and ~95% CI for this sample of flying snakes?


## Example CI calculation

```{r}
#| echo: true

undulation_rate <- c(0.9, 1.2, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.4, 1.6, 2.0)

undulation_mean <- mean(undulation_rate)
undulation_SEM <- SEM(undulation_rate)

lower <- undulation_mean - 2 * undulation_SEM
upper <- undulation_mean + 2 * undulation_SEM

c(lower, undulation_mean, upper)

```


## Compare the estimate to its 95% CI

```{r}
lm(Y ~ X + 1, data = M) |> summary()
```


# Comparison of two means {background-color="#40666e"}


## Comparison of two means

- One categorical predictor (factor) with two levels
    - Internally re-coded as 0 and 1
- One level is the *reference* level
    - Default is alphabetically first factor
    - Be careful with factors coded with integers

> "How much does the outcome variable change (positive or negative) for each 1 unit increase in the predictor?"

:::{.alert}
"1 unit" is $0 \rightarrow 1$ "difference" between groups

- Is mean horn length in live horned lizards *different* than in dead horned lizards?
    - Is the mean horn length larger?
- How does natural variation in horn length impact the observed mean value?

## Horned lizard predation

Simulate data with ~10% difference in horn length:

- Alive: n = 150, mean horn length = 24.5 mm, sd = 2.6
- Dead: n = 30, mean horn length = 22.0 mm, sd = 2.7

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: slide

set.seed(3575575)

Alive <- rnorm(n = 150, mean = 24.5, sd = 2.6)
Dead <- rnorm(n = 30, mean = 22.0, sd = 2.7)
Group <- c(rep("Alive", 150),
           rep("Dead", 30))

HL <- tibble(Horn_Length = c(Alive, Dead),
             Group = factor(Group))

## Model assumptions

- Observations normally distributed *within* groups
    - Not *between* groups (e.g., bimodal distribution when all observations are pooled)
    - e.g., body mass in dimorphic species (gorillas)
- Within-group variances are (approximately) equal

```{r}
#| fig-width: 14
#| fig-align: center

set.seed(21347)
n <- 400

DD <- tibble(Mass = c(rnorm(n, 181.5, 23), rnorm(n, 90.5, 15)),
             Sex = rep(c("Male", "Female"), each = n))

ggplot() +
  geom_density(data = DD, aes(Mass), fill = "gray75") +
  geom_density(data = DD, aes(Mass, color = Sex), linewidth = 2) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("#B66DFF", "#009292")) +
  labs(y = "Density", x = "Body Mass (kg)")

```


## Minimize sums of squares

```{r}

HL$pred <- NA
mu.a <- mean(HL$Horn_Length[HL$Group == "Alive"])
mu.d <- mean(HL$Horn_Length[HL$Group == "Dead"])
HL$pred[HL$Group == "Alive"] <- mu.a
HL$pred[HL$Group == "Dead"] <- mu.d

HL |>
  ggplot(aes(CatJitter, Horn_Length)) +
  geom_segment(data = HL, aes(x = CatJitter, xend = CatJitter,
                              y = Horn_Length, yend = pred),
               color = "firebrick", linewidth = 0.75,
               alpha = 0.75) +
  geom_point(color = "navy", size = 2.5) +

```


## Linear model to compare means

```{r}
#| echo: true

mod <- lm(Horn_Length ~ Group, data = HL)
```

- Looks exactly like an OLS linear model
- `Group` is a factor (or character converted to factor)
    - Be careful with groups defined by numbers
- R internally converts to 0 (Alive) and 1 (Dead)


## Linear model to compare means

```{r}
#| echo: true

summary(mod)
```

- `(Intercept)`: Mean for Alive group
- `GroupDead`: Mean for Alive group + Difference between Alive and Dead


## Group means from a linear model

```{r}
#| echo: true

coef(mod)

HL |> 
  group_by(Group) |> 
  summarize(`Horn Length` = mean(Horn_Length)) |> 
  as.data.frame()
```

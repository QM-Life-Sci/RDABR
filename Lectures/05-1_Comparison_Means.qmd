# Housekeeping {background-color="#40666e"}

- Progress Check 1 due Thursday
    - If you need more time, let us know.
    - Submit qmd and HTML
- Be thinking about / looking for a data set
    - Let us know if you want to discuss

## Plan for this week

- Standard errors: How confident are we in an estimate?
- Intervals around estimates
- Comparison of means
- (Almost) all models are linear models


# Standard errors {background-color="#40666e"}


## Resampling to estimate a mean

```{r}
#| echo: true

set.seed(423766)

x <- rnorm(n = 2000, mean = 10, sd = 4)

resample_means <- function(x, sample_size, n_means) {
  sample_means <- numeric(n_means)
  for (ii in 1:n_means) {
    s <- sample(x, size = sample_size, replace = FALSE)  # <1>
    sample_means[ii] <- mean(s)
  }
  return(sample_means)
}

sm1 <- resample_means(x, sample_size = 20, n_means = 100)
```
1. Randomly sample from x, being sure to not sample the same value twice (`replace = FALSE`).

. . .

```{r}
#| echo: true

sm1[1:10]
```

What will the distribution of sample *means* look like? What will the range be?


## Mean of means: mean = 10, sd = 4

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| warning: false

ggplot(tibble(sm1), aes(sm1)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 30, fill = "gold") +
  labs(x = "Sample Mean", y = "Count",
       title = "sample size = 20; n means = 100") +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(6, 14), breaks = 6:14)
```

```


## Scaling of standard deviation with sample size

```{r}
set.seed(32437)
SDS <- map(.x = c(10, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 750, 1000, 1250, 1500),
           .f = function(.x) {
             sds <- numeric(length = 100)
             for (ii in 1:100) {
               x <- rnorm(.x, mean = 0, sd = 10)
               sds[ii] <- sd(x)
             }
             return(tibble(n = .x,
                           SD = sds))
           }
) |> 
  list_rbind()

ggplot(SDS, aes(x = n, y = SD)) +
  geom_point(position = position_jitter(width = 10, seed = 23553),
             alpha = 0.25, pch = 16,
             size = 2) +
  stat_summary(fun = mean,
               geom = "point",
               size = 4, color = "salmon") +
  labs(x = "Sample Size", y = "Standard Deviation",
       title = "mean = 0; sd = 10",
       caption = "100 iterations")
```


## Standard errors

- Empirically, we see that the estimate is more precise if the number of samples is larger.
- How can we quantify the level of uncertainty?

. . .

Adjust the standard deviation by sample size:

$$
s = \sqrt{\frac{\sum \left(x_i - \bar{x}\right)^2}{n - 1}}
$$

$$SE_{\bar{x}} = \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}$$

How will $SE_{\bar{x}}$ change as $n$ increases?


## Stickleback plates

![](https://i.imgur.com/Xr68AKa.jpg){fig-align="center"}


## Stickleback plates

```{r}
SticklebackPlates <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/QM-Life-Sci/RDABR/refs/heads/main/data/Stickleback_Plates.csv",
                              show_col_types = FALSE)

ggplot(SticklebackPlates, aes(x = plates)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 30, fill = "#6695DE") +
  facet_grid(genotype ~ .) +
  labs(x = "Number of Lateral Body Plates", y = "Count") +
  theme(strip.text = element_text(face = "italic"))
```


## Standard error of the sample mean

```{r}
#| echo: true

SEM <- function(x) {sd(x) / sqrt(length(x))}
```

where `x` is a vector of values.

. . .

Stickleback plate numbers:

```{r}
#| echo: true

SticklebackPlates |> 
  group_by(genotype) |> 
  summarise(Count = length(plates),
            Mean = mean(plates),
            SD_plates = sd(plates),
            SEM_plates = SEM(plates))
```


## Standard errors appear often

- Any time you have a parameter estimate and want to know how confident you are
    - Doesn't tell you about the data
- Sample mean: $SE_{\bar{x}}$ or "SEM"
- SEs for parameter estimates in linear models

. . .

```{r}
set.seed(4)
n <- 30

X <- rnorm(n, mean = 10, sd = 1)
Y <- 2.3 * X + rnorm(n, mean = 1, sd = 1)

M <- tibble(X, Y)

lm(Y ~ X + 1, data = M) |> summary()
```


# What can you do with standard errors? {background-color="#40666e"}


## Compare the standard error to the estimate

```{r}
lm(Y ~ X + 1, data = M) |> summary()
```

If the standard error is many times the estimate, then the estimate is not very confident


## Plot raw data with summary stats

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: slide 

ggplot(SticklebackPlates, aes(x = genotype, y = plates)) +
  geom_point(position = position_jitter(width = 0.2, seed = 423479),
             alpha = 0.25, pch = 16) +
  stat_summary(fun = mean, # <1>
               geom = "point", # <1>
               size = 3, color = "purple") + 
  stat_summary(fun.data = mean_se, # <2>
               geom = "errorbar", # <3>
               width = 0.1,
               linewidth = 1,
               color = "purple") +
  labs(x = "Genotype", y = "Number of Plates") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(face = "italic")) # <4>
```
1. Add a point with the mean
2. Calculate the standard error of the sample mean.
3. Add error bars around the SEM.
4. Italicize the x-axis labels.


# From standard errors to intervals {background-color="#40666e"}


## Intervals describe uncertainty

- Repeat the same experiment
- Same conditions, sample size, etc.

. . .

```{r}

DD1 <- tibble("Treatment" = rep(c("A", "B"),each = 8),
              "Phenotype" = c(rnorm(8, mu1), rnorm(8, mu2)),
              "DataSet" = "G1")

DD2 <- tibble("Treatment" = rep(c("A", "B"),each = 8),

              "Phenotype" = c(rnorm(80, mu1, 6), rnorm(80, mu2, 6)),
              "DataSet" = "G4")

DD <- bind_rows(DD1, DD2, DD3, DD4)


DD |>
  ggplot(aes(Treatment, Phenotype)) +
  geom_point(position = position_jitter(width = 0.2, seed = 423479),
             alpha = 0.25, pch = 16,
             size = 2) +
  stat_summary(fun = mean, geom = "point", size = 4, color = "darkred") + 
  facet_wrap("DataSet", nrow = 2)
```


## Confidence interval for a mean

- Approximate calculation:
    - $n = 30$ to $n = 100$
    - $2$ is an approximation

$$95\%~CI = \bar{x} \pm 2 \times SEM$$

- Exact calculation: 
    - Requires a critical $t$-value and appropriate degrees of freedom for the $t$-distribution
    - Coming soon. Approximate for now...
  

## Confidence intervals

> A confidence interval is a range that we expect, with some level of conﬁdence, to include the true value of a population parameter such as the mean. [@Curran-Everett2009-zz]

Our calculation is based on our expectation from sampling the true population distribution *repeatedly.*

- Same sample size, same experimental conditions
- Same procedures, same analysis


## Plotting confidence intervals

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: slide

DD |>
  ggplot(aes(Treatment, Phenotype)) +
  geom_point(position = position_jitter(width = 0.2, seed = 423479),
             alpha = 0.25, pch = 16) +
  stat_summary(fun = mean, # <1>
               geom = "point",# <1>
               size = 3, color = "firebrick4") + 
  stat_summary(fun.data = mean_cl_normal, # <2>
               geom = "errorbar", # <3>
               width = 0.1,
               linewidth = 1,
               color = "firebrick4") +
  facet_wrap("DataSet", nrow = 2) # <4>

```
1. Add a point with the mean
2. Calculate the confidence interval assuming a normal distribution
3. Add error bars around the SEM.
4. Create a panel for each level of "Dataset" and plot in 2 rows.


## Example CI calculation

Mean undulation rate for *n = 8* [gliding snakes](http://www.flyingsnake.org/){target="_blank"}:

![](http://www.lazerhorse.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Flying-Snake-Chrysopelea.jpg){fig-align="center" width="60%"}

What is the mean undulation rate and ~95% CI for this sample of flying snakes?


## Example CI calculation

```{r}
#| echo: true

undulation_rate <- c(0.9, 1.2, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.4, 1.6, 2.0)

undulation_mean <- mean(undulation_rate)
undulation_mean

undulation_SEM <- SEM(undulation_rate)
undulation_SEM

lower_bound <- undulation_mean - 2 * undulation_SEM
upper_bound <- undulation_mean + 2 * undulation_SEM

c(lower_bound, undulation_mean, upper_bound)

```


## Approximate CI for regression parameter estimates

$$Estimate \pm 2 \cdot Std.~Error$$

```{r}
lm(Y ~ X + 1, data = M) |> summary()
```


# Comparison of two means {background-color="#40666e"}


## Comparison of two means

- One categorical predictor (factor) with two levels
    - Internally re-coded as 0 and 1
- One level is the *reference* level
    - Default is alphabetically first factor
    - Be careful with factors coded with integers

## Are longer horns protective against predation?

::: {.incremental}

- Is mean horn length in live horned lizards *different* than in dead horned lizards?
    - Is the mean horn length larger?
    - Is the mean horn length smaller?
- How does natural variation in horn length impact the observed mean value?
    - What difference(s) do we expect from random sampling of horned lizards?
:::

. . .

:::{.alert}
What is the null hypothesis?
:::


## Simulated data

Simulate data with ~10% difference in horn length:

- Alive: n = 150, mean horn length = 24.5 mm, sd = 2.6
- Dead: n = 30, mean horn length = 22.0 mm, sd = 2.7

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: slide

set.seed(3575575)

Alive <- rnorm(n = 150, mean = 24.5, sd = 2.6)
Dead <- rnorm(n = 30, mean = 22.0, sd = 2.7)
Group <- c(rep("Alive", 150),
           rep("Dead", 30))

HL <- tibble(Horn_Length = c(Alive, Dead),
             Group = factor(Group))
str(HL)
print(HL)
```


## Simulated data

```{r}
HL |> 
  ggplot(aes(Horn_Length)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 30, fill = "#6695DE") +
  facet_grid(Group ~ .) +
  labs(x = "Horn Length (mm)", y = "Count")
```


## Summarize

```{r}
#| echo: true

HL |>
  group_by(Group) |> 
  summarize(n = length(Horn_Length),
            Horn_mean = mean(Horn_Length),
            Horn_sd = sd(Horn_Length),
            Horn_SEM = SEM(Horn_Length))
```


## (How) is the mean different in alive lizards compared to dead lizards?

```{r}
HL$CatNum <- as.numeric(HL$Group) - 1
HL$CatJitter <- HL$CatNum + rnorm(nrow(HL), 0, 0.1)

HL |>
  ggplot(aes(CatJitter, Horn_Length)) +
  geom_point(color = "navy", size = 3) +
  labs(x = "Group", y = "Horn Length (mm)") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(0, 1),
                     labels = c("Alive", "Dead")) +
  theme(text = element_text(size = 20))
```


## Minimize sums of squares

```{r}

HL$pred <- NA
mu.a <- mean(HL$Horn_Length[HL$Group == "Alive"])
mu.d <- mean(HL$Horn_Length[HL$Group == "Dead"])
HL$pred[HL$Group == "Alive"] <- mu.a
HL$pred[HL$Group == "Dead"] <- mu.d

HL |>
  ggplot(aes(CatJitter, Horn_Length)) +
  geom_segment(data = HL, aes(x = CatJitter, xend = CatJitter,
                              y = Horn_Length, yend = pred),
               color = "firebrick", linewidth = 0.75,
               alpha = 0.75) +
  geom_point(color = "navy", size = 2.5) +
  labs(x = "Group", y = "Horn Length (mm)") +
  geom_segment(x = -0.5, y = mu.a, xend = 0.4, yend = mu.a) +
  geom_segment(x = 0.6, y = mu.d, xend = 1.5, yend = mu.d) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(0,1),labels = c("Alive","Dead"))
 
```


## Linear model to compare means

```{r}
#| echo: true

mod <- lm(Horn_Length ~ Group, data = HL)
```

- Looks exactly like an OLS linear model
- `Group` is a factor (or character converted to factor)
    - Be careful with groups defined by numbers
- R internally converts to 0 (Alive) and 1 (Dead)


## Linear model to compare means

```{r}
#| echo: true

summary(mod)
```

- `(Intercept)`: Mean for Alive group
- `GroupDead`: Difference in mean between Alive and Dead groups


## Group means from a linear model

```{r}
#| echo: true

coef(mod)

HL |> 
  group_by(Group) |> 
  summarize(`Horn Length` = mean(Horn_Length),
            `SEM Horn Length` = SEM(Horn_Length),
            Lower = `Horn Length` - 2 * `SEM Horn Length`,
            Upper = `Horn Length` + 2 * `SEM Horn Length`) |> 
  as.data.frame()
```

. . .

What do you think it means that the 95% CIs do not overlap?


## Model assumptions

1. Observations normally distributed *within* groups
    - Not *between* groups
    - e.g., bimodal distribution when all observations are plotted together
2. Within-group variances are (approximately) equal

# Goals {background-color="#40666e"}


## What do we want to accomplish? (Narrow view)

- Begin to learn about the research process
- Begin data analysis / statistics
- Begin data presentation / graphing
- Begin presenting / writing about science
- Begin to use computers to make your scientific life easier


## What do we want to accomplish? (Wide view)

> I'm convinced that coding ... changes the cognitive way one looks at a quantifiable phenomenon. It changes the modality the brain thinks of how to interpret a problem and how to model it (when possible). It forces you to think logically/algorithmically and it allows you to learn better new arguments when this learning is necessary.

> While the comprehension of specific statistical tests is specifically linked to particular problems, general coding skills allow us to imagine (and to realize) simulated experiments, toy examples, etc. I think the benefit is cognitive besides the advantages for scientific rigor/reproducibility and of course for the scientific community.

## What do we want to accomplish? (Wide view)

:::{.alert}
Expand the ways in which you think about and interact with science
:::

- Become a better citizen of science
    - We are all consumers
    - You don't have to be a producer (but it's great if you are)


## Learning Objectives

1.	Describe the processes involved in reproducible research.
2.	Discuss research study design, including considerations of biological sex, race, and ethnicity.
3.	Design studies with appropriate power to answer research questions.
4.	Manage data and maintain data integrity.
5.	Carry out statistical analyses using data relevant to their research questions and interpret those analyses.
6.	Create publication-quality figures for reports, posters, and presentations
7.	Write about and present statistical analyses.


## Desired Student Outcomes

1.	Appreciate that research is a set of skills that can be learned and learn that everyone has a place in research.
2.	Accept that uncertainty is an inherent property of the world and variation is pervasive in nature. We try to make decisions with statistics in the face of that uncertainty and variation.
3.	Recognize that all aspects of science – from planning to presentation – are collaborative and recognize the benefits of diverse points of view in the scientific process.


## Premise

*Axiom 1*: Quantitative potential is distributed equally among different groups, irrespective of geographic, demographic, and economic boundaries.

*Axiom 2*. Everyone can have joyful, meaningful, and empowering quantitative experiences.

*Axiom 3*. Quantitative methods are powerful, malleable tools that can be shaped and used differently by various communities to serve their needs.

*Axiom 4*. Every student deserves to be treated with dignity and respect.

## Course communications from me

- Canvas announcements and messages
    - Sign up for email notifications
- Emails (very rarely)


## Three-week check-in

- How are you doing?
- What is working or not working for you?
- How is the pace?
- What challenges do you have?
- How can I do better?

Maybe again later in the semester

# "Artificial Intelligence" {background-color="#40666e"}


## Artificial intelligence is not intelligence

- We (unfortunately) use human terms to describe LLMs: "intelligence", "learn", "understand", "think", "know", "hallucinate"
- LLMs generate responses based on probabilities (what character/word comes next?), which are derived from their training data.
- [Large Language Models explained briefly (YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPZh9BOjkQs)


:::{.callout-note}
## Predicting based on probability
Predict $y$ if $x = 3$.

$$y = 2x + 3$$
:::


## What are the next two numbers in the sequence?

$$1, 3, 5, 7$$
or

$$1, 3, 5, 7, 17, 19, 21$$

LLMs can answer the first but not the second.


## Ways in which large language models can fail you

- *Outdated and/or incorrect information*: LLMs are trained on historical data, which might have changed or be incorrect
- *Inability to explain*: If you don't code it yourself, you will have greater challenges explaining it
- *Debugging challenges*: If your code doesn't work, then figuring out why will be more challenging
- *Short circuit* the development of problem-solving skills in our learn-by-doing approach
    - Be willing to fail and keep trying.
- *Limiting you creativity and innovation*: There are many ways to solve a coding challenge


## Course AI guidelines: "AI Integration Allowed: Human-in-the-Loop"

- Generative AI may be used in this course. The content you submit is your responsibility. Be sure your work accurately reflects your understanding and avoids these pitfalls.
- You are responsible for understanding what you submit. Simply copying an AI-generated solution does not contribute to gaining understanding.


## Course AI guidelines: "AI Integration Allowed: Human-in-the-Loop"

If you use AI, please acknowledge it with some variation of this statement:

> "I acknowledge the use of AI in completing this assignment and would like to provide a brief explanation of how I utilized AI, specifically [LLM], as a tool to support my work. For this assignment, I employed [LLM] to [describe the specific purpose or task]. To do so I crafted the following prompts: [List prompts used]"


## Before you ask AI, ask yourself ...

... how will this help me learn?
